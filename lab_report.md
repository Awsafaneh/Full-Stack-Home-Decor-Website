### üìò Introduction:

This project involves the development of a responsive full-stack website for a home decor business named **Elegant Interiors**. The website serves as a digital portfolio that showcases services, collects customer service requests, and handles user inquiries through a contact form.

---

### üéØ Objectives:

* To build a user-friendly and responsive home decor website.
* To allow users to submit service requests and contact messages.
* To manage form submissions in the Django admin panel.
* To implement backend logic for handling, storing, and displaying form data.
* To ensure the website is aesthetically pleasing and mobile-friendly.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used:

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend:** Python 3.10, Django 5.2.3
* **Database:** SQLite (default Django database)
* **Others:** Django Admin, Font Awesome, AOS Library, Git

### üåê Web Pages Overview:

1. **Home Page**: Displays a hero banner, about section, services, testimonials, and contact form.
2. **Quote Form**: Allows users to submit their name and phone number for requesting services.
3. **Contact Form**: Lets users submit a detailed message along with their email and phone number.
4. **Admin Panel**: Allows the admin to view and manage submissions.

---

### üé® Design Philosophy:

The website emphasizes a minimalist and elegant aesthetic, reflecting a professional home decor business. Tailwind CSS is used for fast styling and responsiveness, ensuring consistent design across devices.

---

### ‚ú® Key Features:

* Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS.
* Animated elements using AOS (Animate On Scroll).
* Mobile navigation with a toggleable menu.
* Form submission handling using Django's built-in form system.
* Admin interface to view and manage all user requests.
* Back-to-top button and smooth scroll functionality.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced:

* Handling multiple forms (`ServiceRequestForm`, `ContactMessageForm`) on the same page.
* Using Django template filters like `add_class` and `attr` which required loading `widget_tweaks`.
* Preserving form data and success feedback on redirect.
* Ensuring responsiveness on all screen sizes.

---

### üß™ Testing and Validation:

* Manual form testing with valid/invalid input.
* Admin dashboard tested for CRUD operations.
* HTML and CSS validated using W3C validators.
* Console tested for JavaScript errors.

---

### üîê Security Considerations:

* CSRF protection using `{% csrf_token %}` in all forms.
* Input validation through Django's form system.
* Admin access protected through Django's authentication system.
* Auto-escaping enabled to prevent XSS.

---

### üöÄ Future Scope:

* Add email notifications to admin on new form submissions.
* Store service types and dynamically populate from DB.
* Add user authentication for clients to track their requests.
* Implement a blog or gallery section to showcase past projects.
* Integrate payment gateways for consultations.
